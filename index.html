        <h1> Zohre Hashemi</h1>
        <p> Hello
            My name is Zohre, you can call me Zoey as well. I am from Iran. I have a Ph.D degree in Persian Language and Literature.
            I was a faculty member when I was in Iran. I always love drawing and designing, so when I came to Canada, I decided to pursue my dreams.
            Now I am Interactive Media Design student at Algonquin College. I am so excited. Every day I learn a lot of new things.
            Web development is kind of challenging for me so far because I don't have any background information. However, when I write a code and fixed a problem with coding it is so rewarding and enjoying.
