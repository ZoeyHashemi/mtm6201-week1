        <p> Hello<br>
            My name is Zohre, you can call me Zoey as well. I'm from Iran. I have a Ph.D degree in Persian Language and Literature.
            I was a faculty member in Iran. I always love drawing and designing, so when I immigrated to Canada, I decided to pursue my dreams.<br>
            Now I'm Interactive Media Design student at Algonquin College. I am so excited. Every day I learn a lot of new things.
            Web development is kind of challenging for me so far because I don't have any background information. However, when I write a code and fixed a problem with coding it is so rewarding and enjoying.<br>
            I always enjoy to learn new things and up to date my knowledge about history, philosophy and literature. So one of my major interests is reading. Besides a healthy life is important to me,
            So doing exercises regularly is another hobby of mine. I like yoga, running and cycling.Apart from these, sometimes I also play video games.
